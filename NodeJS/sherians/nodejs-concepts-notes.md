# Node.js Backend Development Notes
## Concept Explanations with Simple Examples

---

## PART 1: NODE.JS BASICS

### File System (fs) Module
**Concept:** Node.js can interact with your computer's files and folders through the fs module. It lets you create, read, modify, and delete files programmatically.

**Key Operations:**
- **writeFile()** - Creates new files or overwrites existing ones
- **appendFile()** - Adds content to the end of existing files  
- **rename()** - Changes file names
- **unlink()** - Deletes files permanently
- **rm()** - Removes directories (newer method)

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
fs.writeFile("note.txt", "Hello World", (err) => {
    if(err) console.log(err);
});
```

### HTTP Server Creation
**Concept:** Node.js can create web servers that listen for requests from browsers and send back responses. This is the foundation of all web applications.

```javascript
const http = require('http');
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    res.end("Welcome to my server!");
});
server.listen(3000);
```

**Important:** Async methods don't wait - they run in parallel which can cause timing issues if not handled properly.

## PART 2: NPM PACKAGE MANAGEMENT

### What is NPM?
**Concept:** NPM is like an app store for JavaScript code. It lets you download and use code libraries created by other developers, saving you from writing everything from scratch.

### Version Control
**Concept:** Different versions of packages have different features. You can specify exactly which version you want to avoid breaking changes in your app.

### Dependencies vs Dev Dependencies
**Concept:** 
- **Dependencies** - Code your app needs to run in production
- **Dev Dependencies** - Tools you only need while developing (like testing tools)

```javascript
// package.json
{
  "dependencies": {"express": "^5.0.0"},
  "devDependencies": {"nodemon": "^2.0.0"}
}
```

### NPM Scripts
**Concept:** Custom commands you can run with `npm run scriptname`. Like shortcuts for common tasks.

## PART 3: EXPRESS.JS FRAMEWORK

### What is Express.js?
**Concept:** Express.js is like a foundation/template for building web applications. It provides structure and tools so you don't have to build everything from scratch. Think of it as a pre-built house framework where you just add rooms (routes).

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
app.listen(3000);
```

### Middleware
**Concept:** Middleware is code that runs BETWEEN receiving a request and sending a response. Like security guards that check everyone before they enter a building. Every request passes through middleware first.

```javascript
app.use((req, res, next) => {
    console.log("Someone visited:", req.url);
    next(); // Pass to next middleware/route
});
```

### Routing
**Concept:** Routes are different paths/pages users can visit on your website. Each route can handle different actions (GET to view, POST to create, etc).

```javascript
app.get('/', (req, res) => res.send('Homepage'));
app.get('/about', (req, res) => res.send('About Page'));
app.post('/contact', (req, res) => res.send('Form Submitted'));
```

### Dynamic Routes
**Concept:** Routes that can handle variable parts. Instead of creating separate routes for each user, you create one route that works for any user ID.

```javascript
app.get('/user/:id', (req, res) => {
    res.send(`User: ${req.params.id}`);
});
```

### Error Handling
**Concept:** When something goes wrong, error handlers catch the problem and send a user-friendly message instead of crashing the app.

```javascript
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
    res.status(500).send('Something broke!');
});
```

## PART 4: FORMS, SESSIONS & COOKIES

### Body Parsing
**Concept:** When users submit forms, the data comes in a raw format. Body parsing converts this raw data into JavaScript objects you can easily work with.

```javascript
app.use(express.json()); // For JSON data
app.use(express.urlencoded({extended: true})); // For form data
```

### Cookies
**Concept:** Cookies are small pieces of data stored in the user's browser. Like name tags that help the server remember who you are on future visits.

```javascript
res.cookie('username', 'john');
console.log(req.cookies.username); // 'john'
```

### Sessions
**Concept:** Sessions are server-side storage that remembers user information while they browse your website. Like a temporary locker assigned to each visitor.

---

## PART 6: DYNAMIC ROUTING & PROJECT SETUP

### URL Parameters
**Concept:** Parts of the URL that act like variables. Instead of hardcoding every possible URL, you create flexible routes that handle many variations.

```javascript
// /product/123, /product/456, etc.
app.get('/product/:id', (req, res) => {
    const productId = req.params.id;
});
```

### Query Parameters
**Concept:** Extra information added to URLs with ? and &. Like filters on a shopping website (?color=red&size=large).

```javascript
// /search?q=shoes&category=sports
app.get('/search', (req, res) => {
    console.log(req.query.q); // 'shoes'
});
```

## PART 8: MONGODB BASICS

### What is MongoDB?
**Concept:** MongoDB is a database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format. Unlike traditional databases with rigid tables, MongoDB stores "documents" that can have different structures.

### Mongoose
**Concept:** Mongoose is a tool that makes working with MongoDB easier. It provides structure and validation to your data, like creating rules for what information must be included.

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/myapp');
```

### Schemas
**Concept:** Schemas are blueprints that define what data should look like. They specify what fields are required, what types they should be, etc.

```javascript
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    name: String,
    email: {type: String, required: true},
    age: Number
});
```

## PART 9: MONGODB PROJECT

### CRUD Operations
**Concept:** CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, Delete - the four basic operations you can do with data in any database.

**Create** - Adding new data
```javascript
const user = await User.create({name: 'John', email: 'john@email.com'});
```

**Read** - Finding/retrieving data
```javascript
const users = await User.find(); // Get all users
const user = await User.findOne({email: 'john@email.com'}); // Get one user
```

**Update** - Modifying existing data
```javascript
await User.findOneAndUpdate({email: 'john@email.com'}, {name: 'Johnny'});
```

**Delete** - Removing data
```javascript
await User.findOneAndDelete({email: 'john@email.com'});
```

---

## PART 10: CRUD WITH EJS

### What is EJS?
**Concept:** EJS is a templating engine that lets you create dynamic HTML pages. Instead of static HTML, you can insert JavaScript variables and logic to create pages that change based on data.

```javascript
app.set('view engine', 'ejs');
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.render('homepage', {title: 'Welcome'});
});
```

### EJS Syntax
**Concept:** Special tags that let you mix JavaScript with HTML:
- `<%= %>` - Output variables
- `<% %>` - Execute JavaScript code
- `<%- %>` - Output raw HTML

---

## PART 11: AUTHORIZATION BASICS

### Password Hashing
**Concept:** Never store passwords in plain text. Hashing converts passwords into scrambled strings that can't be reversed. Even if someone steals your database, they can't see actual passwords.

```javascript
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash('userpassword', 10);
const isValid = await bcrypt.compare('userpassword', hashedPassword);
```

### JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
**Concept:** JWTs are like digital ID cards. When users log in successfully, you give them a token that proves they're authenticated. They show this token for future requests.

```javascript
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const token = jwt.sign({userId: 123}, 'secret');
const decoded = jwt.verify(token, 'secret');
```

### Cookies for Authentication
**Concept:** Storing JWT tokens in httpOnly cookies is secure because JavaScript can't access them (prevents XSS attacks), but the browser automatically sends them with requests.

```javascript
res.cookie('token', jwtToken, {httpOnly: true, secure: false});
```

---

## PART 12: COMPLETE AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM

### User Registration Flow
**Concept:** 
1. User submits form with password
2. Server hashes the password  
3. Save user with hashed password to database
4. Create JWT token for the user
5. Send token back in secure cookie

### User Login Flow  
**Concept:**
1. User submits email/password
2. Find user in database by email
3. Compare submitted password with stored hash
4. If match, create new JWT token
5. Send token in cookie, redirect to protected area

### Protected Routes
**Concept:** Routes that require authentication. They check for valid JWT token before allowing access. If no token or invalid token, redirect to login.

```javascript
app.get('/profile', async (req, res) => {
    const token = req.cookies.token;
    if (!token) return res.redirect('/login');
    // Continue if token exists and is valid
});
```

### Logout
**Concept:** Remove the authentication token from user's browser. Like taking away their ID card so they can't access protected areas anymore.

---

## PART 13: DATA ASSOCIATION

### Referencing vs Embedding
**Concept:** Two ways to store related data in MongoDB:

**Referencing** - Store only the ID of related data (like a foreign key). Good for large data that changes frequently.
```javascript
// User document stores only post IDs
{name: 'John', posts: ['postId1', 'postId2']}
```

**Embedding** - Store the complete related data inside the document. Good for small data that rarely changes.
```javascript
// User document contains full post objects  
{name: 'John', posts: [{title: 'Post 1', content: '...'}, {title: 'Post 2', content: '...'}]}
```

### Population
**Concept:** When using referencing, population automatically replaces IDs with actual data when you query. Like automatically looking up full details instead of just seeing ID numbers.

```javascript
const user = await User.findOne().populate('posts');
// Now user.posts contains full post objects, not just IDs
```

## KEY CONCEPTS SUMMARY

### Security Principles
- **Never trust user input** - Always validate and sanitize
- **Hash passwords** - Never store plain text passwords  
- **Use httpOnly cookies** - Prevents JavaScript access to tokens
- **Set token expiration** - Limits damage if token is stolen

### Database Best Practices  
- **Use referencing for large/changing data** - Keeps documents small
- **Use embedding for small/static data** - Reduces database queries
- **Always handle errors** - Database operations can fail
- **Validate data with schemas** - Ensures data consistency

### Development Workflow
- **Use nodemon in development** - Automatically restarts server on changes
- **Structure with MVC pattern** - Separates concerns (Models, Views, Controllers)
- **Implement error handling** - Graceful failure instead of crashes
- **Use environment variables** - Keep secrets out of code
