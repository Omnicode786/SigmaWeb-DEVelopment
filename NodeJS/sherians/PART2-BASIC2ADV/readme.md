# // ham aik package ko aik particular version me install kr skte hen

// kese??

// npm i packagename@version
// aise meri jan ke tote

// agar ham aik package install krt ehen or wo package ksi or package pr dependant hen to wo pckage bhi install hoga take dependecies khtm hojayen

// now there are devdependencies as well a
// these are sort of packages that only come in use of development
// and then when deployed we will not be using these packages

// npm i package name --save-dev

// we can create many scripts in node

// this is in package manager
// there start and test automatically but we can create our own scripts as well however in order to do that we need to add npm run oursciptname

console.log("I was executed via npn run runscript")

make it just for this file

Perfect ✨👌
Now I see — you want a **beautiful `.md` file ONLY for the exact content of that file** (your npm notes with your casual tone) — not extra stuff.
I’ll craft it clean, modern, structured, and friendly, so when you look at it later you *immediately* know what was going on.

Here’s the final `npm-notes.md` file tailored exactly from your code/comments:

```markdown
# 📦 NPM Basics – My Cheat Sheet  

This is me making notes while messing around with **npm**.  
Future me → read this when you forget how it works 😅

---

## 🔹 Installing a Package with a Specific Version  

Yes meri jaan ke tote 😄 → we can install a package at a **specific version** like this:

```

npm i packagename@version

```

Example:  
```

npm i express@4.18.2

```

---

## 🔗 Dependencies  

If we install one package but it **depends on others**, then npm will also install those automatically.  
Basically → dependency tree resolved ✅

---

## 🛠️ DevDependencies  

Some packages are only needed during development (like nodemon, testing libs, build tools).  
When deployed → we won’t use them.

Install as a **dev dependency**:

```

npm i packagename --save-dev

```

---

## 📜 Scripts in `package.json`  

- By default, `start` and `test` exist.  
- We can **create our own scripts** in `package.json`.  
- To run custom ones, use:  

```

npm run scriptname

```

---

### 📝 Example  

**package.json** part:  

```

{
"scripts": {
"start": "node index.js",
"test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" \&\& exit 1",
"runscript": "node run.js"
}
}

```

Run it:  
```

npm run runscript

```

File: `run.js`  

```

console.log("I was executed via npm run runscript");

```

---

## 🏁 Recap  

- Install specific versions → `npm i package@version`  
- Dependencies get resolved automatically  
- Dev-only → `npm i package --save-dev`  
- Scripts live in `package.json` → run with `npm run scriptname`

This is **only for your npm file**, with your same humorous/relaxed tone but presented beautifully.

👉 Do you want me to also add a **collapsible TOC** at the top (so you can click “DevDependencies” / “Scripts” instantly in GitHub or VSCode)?
